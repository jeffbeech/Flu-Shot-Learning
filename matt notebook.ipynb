    "Because this dataset is part of a competition and a train-test split has already been performed, we'll treat the training data as the entire dataset. That way, we can perform our own train-test split, and, subsequently, we'll be able to acquire test scores of our own without necessarily having to submit to the competition. However, if at any point we're satisfied with a model, we can use that model to make predictions on the competition's original test data and submit those predictions to the competition if we so wish. As such, we'll import the competition's testing data as 'y_test_comp'.\n",
